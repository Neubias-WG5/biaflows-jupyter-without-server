# biaflows-jupyter-without-server

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Neubias-WG5/biaflows-jupyter-without-server.git/c886026b926c0c37f82b8b5ecce1fbe9feb2248b)

This was an attempt to use the BIAFLOW docker images directly on mybinder. It is not possible because there is no docker daemon. However it can be done by running the wrapper-script instead of the docker image.

For using NEUBIAS on mybinder, see:

[Jupyter_SpotDetection-IJ](https://github.com/Neubias-WG5/Jupyter_SpotDetection-IJ)

For using NEUBIAS locally, see:
